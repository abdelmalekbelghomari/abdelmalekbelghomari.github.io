title: Japan Internship Feedback 
---

After spending 4 months in Tokyo, Japan with PhD Ryosuke Hosaka, here my feedback on this incredible journey I experienced.<br>

## My wish :

First of all, I wanted to work in the field of AI in a foreign country to achieve my work-abroad intership. I instantly thought about Japan to do so. I already had been in Tokyo and Kansai-region as a tourist. After this trip I crazily enjoyed, I wanted to come-back as a professional and spend more time in this country.

## My research :

Seeking for an intership in Japan, I first tried to aim for business companies to get my first profeesional experience in Software Devlopment and AI. However, the language barrier was the issue. Most of the companies were asking for japanese-fluent candidates and I was studiying japanese for only 2 weeks at this time.
<br>Also, I wanted to push my knowledge further and try to use my capacities for another field than Software Engineering. That's when I thought about joining a research laboratory. I focused on research about science like medecine, biology, pyshics or chemistery. I have a physics and chemistery background from my bachelor.

After sending multiple emails and having several interviews, I finally chose to work at the [Neural Information Systems](https://sites.google.com/shibaura-it.ac.jp/nis/home?authuser=0) at [Shibaura Instite of Technology](https://www.shibaura-it.ac.jp/en/index.html).
