<p>Last weekend, I had the exceptional opportunity to participate in a hackathon organized by LCL in collaboration with Google Cloud Platform. This event brought together tech enthusiasts around an ambitious challenge: deploying an AI ChatBot using Gemini AI, specialized in advising on LCL’s bank cards.</p>

<h2 id="a-stimulating-technological-challenge">A stimulating technological challenge</h2>
<p>Our mission was to create an intelligent virtual assistant capable of guiding clients in choosing and using the bank cards offered by LCL. To do this, we leveraged the power of Gemini AI, a cutting-edge technology developed by Google, enabling the design of advanced artificial intelligence models.</p>

<h2 id="collaboration-and-learning">Collaboration and learning</h2>
<p>Working alongside professionals and students who share the same passion for innovation was extremely enriching. We collaborated to overcome technical challenges, shared our knowledge, and learned new skills, particularly in deploying on Google Cloud Platform.</p>

<h2 id="results-and-perspectives">Results and perspectives</h2>
<p>After two intense days of work and collaboration, we succeeded in deploying a functional ChatBot. This virtual assistant is capable of answering client questions about LCL’s bank cards, thereby offering an improved user experience and easier access to information.</p>

<p><img src="/abdelmalek.github.io/images/me_with_the_yakuza.jpg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></p>

<h2 id="my-wish-">My wish :</h2>

<p>First of all, I wanted to work in the field of AI in a foreign country to achieve my work-abroad intership. I instantly thought about Japan to do so. I already had been in Tokyo and Kansai-region as a tourist. After this trip I crazily enjoyed, I wanted to come-back as a professional and spend more time in this country.</p>

<h2 id="my-research-">My research :</h2>

<p>Seeking for an intership in Japan, I first tried to aim for business companies to get my first profeesional experience in Software Devlopment and AI. However, the language barrier was the issue. Most of the companies were asking for japanese-fluent candidates and I was studiying japanese for only 2 weeks at this time.
<br />Also, I wanted to push my knowledge further and try to use my capacities for another field than Software Engineering. That’s when I thought about joining a research laboratory. I focused on research about science like medecine, biology, pyshics or chemistery. I have a physics and chemistery background from my bachelor.</p>

<p>After sending multiple emails and having several interviews, I finally chose to work at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/shibaura-it.ac.jp/nis/home?authuser=0">Neural Information Systems</a> at <a href="https://www.shibaura-it.ac.jp/en/index.html">Shibaura Instite of Technology</a>.</p>

<h2 id="purpose-of-the-laboratory-">Purpose of the Laboratory :</h2>

<p>Neural Nteworks have been created by biomimetism mimicking the brain architecture. But what if we can understand the brain from these artificial neurons? That’s what we do at Hosaka’s Laboratory. Instead of using classical perceptrons, we use bio-inspired neurons, following the electrical connectivity laws within the brain.</p>

<p>Here is what is explained on the laboratory’s website:</p>

<p><em>The Neuroinformation Systems Laboratory crosses neuroscience and machine learning, to understand the brain and to realise machine learning of the same mechanisms as the brain. Therefore, the common areas of neuroscience and machine learning are the research targets. The following areas are currently the subject of research:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reinforcement learning <br /> Reservoir computing <br /> Stochastic resonance <br /> Excitatory-inhibitory balance <br /> Data assimilation</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="my-research--1">My Research :</h2>

<p>During my 4-months internship, I have been working on <strong>Reservoir Computing</strong>.</p>

<p>I had to do research about Resvervoir Computing models and especilally on <strong>Liquid State Machines</strong>, which are Reservoir Computers. My goal was to identify and find an echo property for these models. You will more information about it on these reports I have written.</p>

<h2 id="my-experience-">My Experience :</h2>

<p>What I keep from this experience is all the knowledge I acquired in only 4 months. I also made life-time friends and managed to to exchange and discuss with many researchers from around the world. My english communication just kept to get better and same for my japanese. I discovered so many cultures, met numerous people and have unforgettable memories.</p>

<p>I sincerely thank all the laboratory for this fabulous journey. If you ever read this, I hope to see you again guys and share another 川飯 with you !</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[After spending 4 months in Tokyo, Japan with PhD Ryosuke Hosaka, here my feedback on this incredible journey I experienced.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My blog have been succesfully created !</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/abdelmalek.github.io/Hello-World/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My blog have been succesfully created !" /><published>2024-09-10T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2024-09-10T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/abdelmalek.github.io/Hello-World</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/abdelmalek.github.io/Hello-World/"><![CDATA[<p>This is the first article I post to make some tests in the code.<br />
