<p>Last weekend, I had the exceptional opportunity to participate in a hackathon organized by LCL in collaboration with Google Cloud Platform. This event brought together tech enthusiasts around an ambitious challenge: deploying an AI ChatBot using Gemini AI, specialized in advising on LCL’s bank cards.</p>

<h2 id="a-stimulating-technological-challenge">A stimulating technological challenge</h2>
<p>Our mission was to create an intelligent virtual assistant capable of guiding clients in choosing and using the bank cards offered by LCL. To do this, we leveraged the power of Gemini AI, a cutting-edge technology developed by Google, enabling the design of advanced artificial intelligence models.</p>

<h2 id="collaboration-and-learning">Collaboration and learning</h2>
<p>Working alongside professionals and students who share the same passion for innovation was extremely enriching. We collaborated to overcome technical challenges, shared our knowledge, and learned new skills, particularly in deploying on Google Cloud Platform.</p>

<h2 id="results-and-perspectives">Results and perspectives</h2>
<p>After two intense days of work and collaboration, we succeeded in deploying a functional ChatBot. This virtual assistant is capable of answering client questions about LCL’s bank cards, thereby offering an improved user experience and easier access to information.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My rewarding experience at the LCL hackathon with Google Cloud Platform Last weekend, I had the exceptional opportunity to participate in a hackathon organized by LCL in collaboration with Google Cloud Platform.
